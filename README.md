# Papers
A collection of papers, theses, publications, and books (drafts) on Haskell, Type Theory, Category Theory, FRP, and other FPs related topics

This repository is meant for personal archiving.  The pdf found with the sub folders are taken directly from the professor's / researcher's / doctor's university site.  If the author would like for particular publications to be removed, contact me and I will remove them.
